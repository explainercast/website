The surprising physics of sailing!

This is the first episode of Explainercast where Shane and Dave explain sailing! This is the 1st episode
in a series about sailing.

The main question to answer is whether this will truly be 1 of only 2 total episodes
on sailing given Shane's profound depth of knowledge on this topic.
